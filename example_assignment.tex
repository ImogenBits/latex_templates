\documentclass[group=123, sheet=1]{assignment}
\course{Boring Math}
% the course, group, and sheet can all be specified via either documentclass options or their slash commands.
% when using the documentclass options, latex strips all spaces so sometimes you have to use the slash commands.
% e.g. the above invokation is equivalent to:
% \documentclass{assignment}
% \group{123}
% \sheet{1}
% \course{Boring Math}
%
% but this will lead to the course being displayed as "BoringMath":
% \documentclass[group=123, sheet=1, course=Boring Math]{assignment}
%
% you can also specify the 'language=german' or 'language=english' option (defaults to english).
% adding the 'pointsbox' option will include a text field where your TA can enter your point total.
% all of the info fields are optional, a minimal use is just '\documentclass{assignment}' with no other commands.

% group members are added via the \member{full name}{matriculation number} command
\member{Ada Lovelace}{486921}
\member{Emmy Noether}{077734}
\member{Margaret Hamilton}{160769}


% the commondefns package includes package imports and macro definitions I often use.
% by default it only does slight improvements to text layout and includes commonly used math libraries.
% you can turn them off with 'notext' and/or 'nomath'. when using the math parts, it will change the definitions of
% some commonly disliked variable letter renderings, if you want to keep the default ones you can pass 'keepvarletters'.
% the option 'graphs' imports tikz, commonly used libraries, and defines generally useful styles.
% 'logic', 'complexity' contain macros that are useful when working in the respective fields.

    This is our Assignment!

    We can now use pretty versions of $\phi$ and $\epsilon$, the round verion of $\phi$ is also available $\ophi$.

    Common logic symbols are easy to use:\\
    If $\FO \supseteq \Phi \models \A$ for some infinite \A, then for every cardinal $\kappa \geq |\A|$ there exists a $\B \models \Phi$ with $|\B| \geq \kappa$.

    And the same is true for complexity classes:\\
    For any function $f(n) \in \Omega(\log n)$, $\cNSPACE(f(n)) = \cco\cNSPACE(f(n))$.

    We can also make some graphs:\\
    \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes=outline]
        \node (1) at (0, 0) {a};
        \node (2) at (1, 0) {b};
        \node (3) at (1.5, -1) {c};
        \node (4) at (2, -0.5) {d};
        \node (5) at (0.5, -1) {e};
        \draw (1) to (2);
        \draw (2) to (3);
        \draw (3) to (1);
        \draw (3) to (4);
        \draw (5) to (1);
        \draw (5) to (3);
    \end{tikzpicture},
    \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes=letters, nodes=red]
