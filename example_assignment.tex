    This is our Assignment!

    We can now use pretty versions of $\phi$ and $\epsilon$, the round verion of $\phi$ is also available: $\ophi$.

    Common logic symbols are easy to use:\\
    If $\FO \supseteq \Phi \models \A$ for some infinite \A, then for every cardinal $\kappa \geq |\A|$ there exists a $\B \models \Phi$ with $|\B| \geq \kappa$.

    And the same is true for complexity classes:\\
    For any function $f(n) \in \Omega(\log n)$,\\
    $\N\SPACE(f(n)) = \co\N\SPACE(f(n))$ and $\N\SPACE(f(n)) \subseteq \SPACE(f(n)^2)$.

    We can also make some graphs:\\
    \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes=outline]
        \node (1) at (0, 0) {a};
        \node (2) at (1, 0) {b};
        \node (3) at (1.5, -1) {c};
        \node (4) at (2, -0.5) {d};
        \node (5) at (0.5, -1) {e};
        \draw (1) to (2);
        \draw (2) to (3);
        \draw (3) to (1);
        \draw (3) to (4);
        \draw (5) to (1);
        \draw (5) to (3);
    \end{tikzpicture},
    \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes=letters, nodes=rwth-magenta]
        \node (1) at (0, 0) {a};
        \node (2) at (0.5, -0.65) {b};
        \node (3) at (1.5, -1) {c};
        \node (4) at (2, -0.5) {d};
        \node (5) at (0, -1) {e};

        \draw (2) to (3);
        \draw (3) to (1);
        \draw (3) to (4);
